                        Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.
                        Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art.

                        The design of buildings and spaces, and the skills and knowledge involved, vary greatly throughout history and among societies.
                        Architects consider many factors in their work, including sustainability, aesthetics, and the use of space.
